== NOTES ==
1) All the files associated with the router (listed above) should be present 
   in the run directory.

2) The benchmark, solution.pl and parameter.set files may be present in a different directory.

3) If you would like to compare the routing results of NCTU-GR 2.0 on ISPD2008 benchmarks with other gloabl routing works, please note that other works does not route the nets that have more than 1000 pins but NCTU-GR 2.0 routes every nets.


== INSTRUCTION TO SET PARAMETERS ==
Users can tune the setting in <Parameter.set> file to control the behavior of NCTU-GR 2.0 to trade off the solution qulaity and runtime.

//Parameters related to regular mode, fast mode, and routability optimizer
1. NCTU-GR targets to minimize TotalWirelength+VIA_COST*numVia,
    so VIA_COST is the weight to each single via.
2. Larger Wirelength_Optimization_Level makes NCTU-GR run slower but get shoter wirelength.
3. Pin_Blockage_Factor is a factor to make NCTU-GR be aware of local congestion.
   If Pin_Blockage_Factor=0, NCTU-GR ignores local congestion.
   If Pin_Blockage_Factor>0, NCTU-GR formulates local congestion into its routing model.
   More details are introduced by the following paper.   
   "GLARE: Global and Local Wiring Aware Routability Evaluation", in Proc. DAC, 2012.

//Parameters related to routability optimizer
4. The value of Placement_Iteration controls the optimization iteration of routability optimizer.  
5. Each iteration of routability optimizer includes global re-placement and detailed placement stages.
6. The value of Rounds_Per_Iteration controls the round number of the global re-placement stage.
7. The value of Avoiding_Blockage_Factor  controls the round number of the detailed placement stage.
8. Larger value of Avoiding_Blockage_Factor can avoid placing too many cells next to blockages.
9. Please don't change the value of Blockage_Expanding.

//Parameters related to regular mode and fast mode
10. The values of Pattern_Routing_Iteration, Monotonic_Routing_Iteration, Maze_Routing_Iteration,
      and Post_Routing_Iteration can control the iterations of each routing stage.
11. If Maze_Routing_Iteration = -1, the maze routing stage finishes when overflows = 0
12. NCTU-GR provides three layer assignment algorithms to trade off runtime and via count.
     If Layer_Assignment_Algorithm = 1, greedy layssignment is used. (very fast, bad quality)
     If Layer_Assignment_Algorithm = 2, DP-based layssignment is used. (fast, good qulaity)
     If Layer_Assignment_Algorithm = 3, negotiation-based layssignment is used. (slow, best quality)
13. Please set 3D_Optimization_Iteration to zero because there is a bug in the 3D optimization stage
